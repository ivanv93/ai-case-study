# Credo AI Case Study
## Overview and Origin
* Credo AI
* Incorporated in 2020
* Founded by Navrina Singh, and co-founder Eli Chen.
* Founder, Navrina Singh, explains she began looking at the problem of AI Governance while running teams focused on building robotics appications. She was then faced with the same problem when her career lead her to cloud and building applications, especially focused on facial recognition, large language models, NLP systems, and running a conversational AI team at Microsoft. She was concerned about the safety of humans and ensuring that these systems are really serving us and our purpose.
* Credo AI is funded by investors; Sands Capital, Decibel VC, AI Fund, and Village Global. On May 17, 2022, they announced they raised $12.8 million in Series A funding, which brought their total to over $18 million since the company was founded.
## Business Activities
* Credo's goal is to help companies minimize AI-related risk by ensuring their AI is fair, compliant, secure, auditable, and human-centered.
* Credo's intended customer is any company looking to implement new generative AI tools and are worried about how theyâ€™d monitor and measure their products and systems for things like bias, safety and security, and compliance. Some of their customers are part of the world's 1000 largest customers like Booz Allen, Mastercard, and Northrup Grumman.
* Navrina Singh, their founder and CEO is a member of the National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee (NAIAC). The committee advises President Biden and the National AI Initiative Office. I believe this gives them an unfair advantage over their competitors because their AI Governance platform can be more easily integrated into global policy and standards.
* To help companies with safe AI adoption, Credo recently rolled out a set of Large Language Model(LLM) powered features to help speed up the process of AI governance, risk management, and compliance. The three main features are; AI use case intake with AI Assist, AI powered risk scenario recommendations, and AI powered control recommendations.
## Landscape
* Credo is part of the software development field, focused on AI Governance.
* In May 2023, OneTrust launched OneTrust Artificial Intelligence Governance which helps organizations manage risks related to AI and ML. In the same month, OpenAI announced grants for experiments focused on how AI software governance can properly address bias, while IBM launched Watson X. In December 2023, D2L partnered with INQ Consulting to launch a new free course known as Introduction to AI Ethics and Governance. Lastly, Meta and IBM launched the AI Alliance in December 2023.
* Some of the other major companies in the field are IBM, Microsoft, SAP SE, H20.ai Inc., Informatica LLC, OneTrust LLC, Accenture, and Salesforce.com Inc
## Results
* Credo was named as a Technology Pioneer in 2022 by the World Economic Forum. This award acknowledges start-up and growth-stage companies with the potential to impact business and society through new technologies.
* It was difficult for me to find exact core metrics to measure the success of Credo, and other companies in the field of AI Governance, since it is such a new concept. Credo is still looking to empower organizations to create AI with the highest ethical standard by allowing business and technical stakeholders to measure, manage and monitor AI risks, to ensure ethical, auditable and compliant AI development. So the only way I saw to measure their performance was by looking at their funding. They were founded in 2020 with a funding of $5.5 million and has raised an additional $12.8 million since.
* Credo is the leading governance platform for building AI that is compliant, secure, safe, auditable, and fair. They are also the only AI Governance Platform integrated into global policy and standards.
## Recomendations
* Since Credo AI has their hands in multiple industries, I narrowed my focus to the medical industry. Apixio, their competitor, uses Risk Adjustment Solution Suite to identify HCCs (Hierarchical Categorical Categories) across a population of patients. Identifying HCCs helps in getting a complete picture of the impact of a health problem has, as far as the financial cost, mortality rate, and morbidity rate.
* With the adoption of this Risk Adjustment Solution suite, Credo would be able to equip their medical industry customers with the ability to improve clinical, operational, and financial results.
* Apixio's Risk Adjustment Solution Suite consists of 3 parts; HCC Identifier, HCC Auditor, and HCC Complete. These programs use AI to identify missed codes and known codes, that may not be supported. Once identified, the codes are organized in a workflow for review. This allows QA teams to review more charts more efficiently, ensuring complete and accurate coding.
* Using this AI based quality and compliance application would help cut audit workloads and improve the speed and accuracy of the audits.
