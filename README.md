# Credo AI Case Study
## Overview and Origin
* Credo AI
* Incorporated in 2020
* Founded by Navrina Singh, and co-founder Eli Chen.
* Founder, Navrina Singh, explains she began looking at the problem of AI Governance while running teams focused on building robotics appications. She was then faced with the same problem when her career lead her to cloud and building applications, especially focused on facial recognition, large language models, NLP systems, and running a conversational AI team at Microsoft. She was concerned about the safety of humans and ensuring that these systems are really serving us and our purpose.
* Credo AI is funded by investors; Sands Capital, Decibel VC, AI Fund, and Village Global. On May 17, 2022, they announced they raised $12.8 million in Series A funding, which brought their total to over $18 million since the company was founded.
## Business Activities
* Credo's goal is to help companies minimize AI-related risk by ensuring their AI is fair, compliant, secure, auditable, and human-centered.
* Credo's intended customer is any company looking to implement new generative AI tools and are worried about how theyâ€™d monitor and measure their products and systems for things like bias, safety and security, and compliance. Some of their customers are part of the world's 1000 largest customers like Booz Allen, Mastercard, and Northrup Grumman.

## Landscape
* Credo is part of the software development field, focused on AI Governance.
*
* Some of the other major companies in the field are IBM, Microsoft, NVIDIA Monitaur, Inc., and Holistic AI.
## Results
* Credo was named as a Technology Pioneer in 2022 by the World Economic Forum. This award acknowledges start-up and growth-stage companies with the potential to impact business and society through new technologies.
* It was difficult for me to find exact core metrics to measure the success of Credo, and other companies in the field of AI Governance, since it is such a new concept. Credo is still looking to empower organizations to create AI with the highest ethical standard by allowing business and technical stakeholders to measure, manage and monitor AI risks, to ensure ethical, auditable and compliant AI development. So the only way I saw to measure their performance was by looking at their funding. They were founded in 2020 with a funding of $5.5 million and has raised an additional $12.8 million since.
* Credo is the leading governance platform for building AI that is compliant, secure, safe, auditable, and fair. They are also the only AI Governance Platform integrated into global policy and standards.
